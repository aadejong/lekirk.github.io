				<h2>“May your trails be crooked, winding, lonesome, dangerous, leading to the most amazing view. May your mountains rise into and above the clouds. May your rivers flow without end, meandering through pastoral valleys tinkling with bells, past temples and castles and poets towers into a dark primeval forest where tigers belch and monkeys howl, through miasmal and mysterious swamps and down into a desert of red rock, blue mesas, domes and pinnacles and grottos of endless stone, and down again into a deep vast ancient unknown chasm where bars of sunlight blaze on profiled cliffs, where deer walk across the white sand beaches, where storms come and go as lightning clangs upon the high crags, where something strange and more beautiful and more full of wonder than your deepest dreams waits for you—beyond that next turning of the canyon walls.” – Edward Abbey, Desert Solitaire</h2>

					<h2>"A friend once told me that Screaming Skull wasn’t a 'real' band since it was a recording project and that we weren’t playing out much. All of that said, this band has truthfully been the most real and honest project that I’ve ever been a part of, and I’m incredibly thankful for every moment and every bit of emotion/energy that my friends and I put into it. Thank you to everyone who helped me pull this band together and to those who filled in on different instruments, helped booked our shows, took our photos, created art for us, bought merch and came to check us out on the East and West coast." – Justin Gonyea</h2>
