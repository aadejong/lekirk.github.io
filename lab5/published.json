He fell off his board, hit his head on\ngravel, and was brain-dead within hours. The swiftest \u2028ambulance and the most skilled surgeon could not save him from the\nbleeding inside his skull. I was about to say that this song is for Jake, but\nthat\u2019s silly, \u2028because Jake isn\u2019t alive anymore. It\u2019s just another of\nthose impulses to \u2028personify the dead so I\ncan pretend that he isn\u2019t really gone forever. But he is. So instead, let me\nsay that this song is for us. It\u2019s for those of us who still have life, and\nstill have an opportunity to do something with it. So do something with it.\nBecause that\u2019s all we have, until we don\u2019t.\u201d \u2014<em> Aaron</em><em><br></em></div><div><em><br></em></div><div><em>Your hand is\nstill warm but no tension is there. While I cling to it, slumped in this\nhospital chair. And I choke out some nonsense about how I\u2019ll see you again. But\nI say these things to deny that I lack the courage to say goodbye. And I hum an\nold song we wrote when we were young while my jagged voice cracks and bends.\nAnd it\u2019s you\u2026The melody strays out of tune. But it\u2019s you...just you, the music\nand me. Down the hall at the chapel they speak of a plan so mysterious that we </em><em>\u2028</em><em>cannot understand. How can this non-explanation assuage\nany grief? Do they tell the orphans who survived inexplicable horrors of\ngenocide that god has a design and he kept you in mind when your parents were\nshot in the street? I rather think that there\u2019s no reason for this, and chaos\ndecides when we cease to exist. But how can I say that to mothers who bury\ntheir sons? Instead, I choose not to speak, and put on my headphones so I can\nthink. And it\u2019s you\u2026Your guitar\u2019s distorted and blue. But it\u2019s you\u2026just you,\nthe music and me. Friends, we gather together again. We\u2019re fewer than last we\nmet but moments of silence are somber, uptight. No, we mourn as loud as we can.\nSo can I get an amen? Let\u2019s start up the dirge and we\u2019ll sing our last goodbye.\nSing goodbye. Goodbye my old comrade, goodbye my dear friend. It shreds me that\nI\u2019ll never see you again. But I\u2019m proud to say we never sat around waiting to\ndie. We were saved by spectacular sounds that moved us to make our paradise\nnow. And we made the air shake because we </em><em></em><em>wouldn\u2019t wait to\nget the best out of life. This savior is not something you can see, it twists\nthe intestines and chatters the teeth and it pulses the heart and it pours from\nour hands and our throats. I feel the band starting to play, I close my eyes,\nmy skull resonates. And it\u2019s you\u2026your memory is vivid and true.

So, thanks to Justin for doing this\nproject. I\u2019ve pretty much not mentioned The Faux being on this compilation so\nas to surprise the members from the line-up on this early and rare track, so\nthis track goes out to Ginn, Donnie, Jaux, Rob, too.
